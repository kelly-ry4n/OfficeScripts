Here is a quick walkthrough of using the admin tools.

1. Creating a valid project for build tools

We need to have a project with a file called "officescriptinfo.py" which contains a dictionary with some information about the project and its scripts. This file is the only special requirement for a project.

Here is a sample officescriptinfo.py. It is in the top level directory of its git folder.

The list of dictionaries contain all the info for build tools. In this case, the project hosts
two scripts, "testscript.py" and "testscript2.py".

The total contents of the director is

    .git/
    mything.txt
    officescriptinfo.py
    README.md
    testscript.py
    testscript.pyc
    testscript2.py

"officescriptinfo.py"
=======================================

## Define some tests for testscript

import testscript
def test1():
    assert 1 == 1

def test2():
    assert testscript.testfunc() is None

script_1_tests = [test1,test2]

## a list of dictionaries, each defining a script in this directory
officeinfo = [{ ## This is the first script in the folder
                "name"        : "testscript.py",
                "version"     : "0.1",
                "contact"     : "Kelly Ryan - kelly.ry4n@gmail.com",
                "description" : "A test script for admin tools",
                "manual"      : "This script prints testscript.py Script executed!",
                "tests"       : script_1_tests,
                "url"         : "https://github.com/kelly-ry4n/test_script"
            }, { ## This is the second
                "name"        : "testscript2.py",
                "version"     : "0.1",
                "contact"     : "Kelly Ryan - kelly.ry4n@gmail.com",
                "description" : "A short descrition of the second test",
                "manual"      : "Detailed project usage information",
                "tests"       : [], ## No tests for this script. Naughty naughty.
                "url"         : "https://github.com/kelly-ry4n/test_script"
            }]

"testscript.py"
=========================================



def testfunc():
    return None

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "testscript.py Script executed!"



"testscript2.py"
=========================================

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "test script 2 executed"


=========================================


In other words, to make a project a valid OfficeScripts project, it must have "officescriptinfo.py" in the top level directory, and in that file the list of dictionaries "officeinfo" must be defined.


The second requirement is that we will pull from the "officescript" branch of ALL projects. This allows people to have a stable working version for officescripts, and still use their git folder like normal.



2. adding a new project

First, make sure you're properly synced with git. I don't want to think about the bugs being unsynced could cause.

The url of our test project is https://github.com/kelly-ry4n/OfficeScripts. We are going to name it "test_proj" in the state "alpha". I created the branch "officescript" in the project, which is a stable branch of master.

To add a project, navigate to /admin/

>python ./newuser.py

    Project/Folder Name: test_proj
    State (alpha | beta | release): alpha
    Github url: https://github.com/kelly-ry4n/test_script
